# WELCOME!!

# This is prompt.ly. Prompt better, think better.

prompt.ly works just like a standard chatbot, but it provides tailored feedback on prompt depth and conceptual understanding too. It also makes its response terser if it detects poor prompt quality.

## Setup and Run Instructions

** The Easy Way **

Just go to promptly-frontend-dcbp.onrender.com - all the work is done for you!

** The Harder Way **

1. From the root of the directory, run: `bash pip install -r requirements.txt `
2. Run: `bash npm install`
3. In one terminal window, run: `bash ./start_backend.sh `
4. In another terminal window, run: `bash ./start_frontend.sh `
5. If your browser does not automatically open, navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Usage Examples

This product is designed for academic and business audiences.

** Academic **

Schools at all levels are under immense pressure with the surge of generative AI to both prepare students for an AI-first environment in the workplace and ensure that students are properly learning. prompt.ly allows students to make the most of Gen AI's powerful output while also keeping them honest to make sure they properly consdier the material they are asking about before seeking answers. Questions like "how do I answer this math problem?" will be answered with a response like "what do you think is an appropriate approach? Let's work together," and questions like "Summarize Moby Dick" will be answered with a response like "what aspects in particular? Are there particular themes or characters that you'd like to focus on?"

** Business **

Businesses are also confronted with a dual-pronged challenge with GenAI - how can they allow their workers to make the most of AI's efficiency gains while maintaining important skills in senior employees and building necessary skills in junior employees? prompt.ly once again answers this question by providing deep critical thinkers with the answers they are looking for and steering less sophisticated prompters to think about how they can be more effective in their prompting.

## Proof of Efficacy

In the next few weeks, I am running a study to determine if this tool is effective. The format of the study will mirror that of the May 2025 MIT Study that found that heavy LLM use is associated with cognitive decline. In the study, participants will be asked to complete a series of timed SAT-style essays with some form of assistance. This assistance will either be: nothing, Google, ChatGPT, or prompt.ly. Responses will then be independently evaluated for quality, and tests will be run to determine both recall/ownership of the work from the original authors and ability to do the task unassisted. The goal of this experiment is to see if prompt.ly helps test subjects generate high-quality output with stronger senses of ownership and ability to repeat the activity at a later date.
