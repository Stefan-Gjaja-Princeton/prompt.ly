// IMPORTANT NOTE: This and the icon options were made by Cursor when I asked for specific
// logos for my product based on specific criteria, and it came up with three different ones.

// Option D: Friendly mascot — the "p" is the head
import IconOptionD from "./IconOptionD";

// Option E: Chat-bubble character with eyes in the "p" bowl
// import IconOptionE from "./IconOptionE";

// Option F: Monoline badge — bowl of the p doubles as a face
// import IconOptionF from "./IconOptionF";

// The active icon
const PromptlyMascot = IconOptionD;
// const PromptlyMascot = IconOptionE;
// const PromptlyMascot = IconOptionF;

export default PromptlyMascot;
